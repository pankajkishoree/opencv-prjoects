I'm excited to share that I’ve successfully completed a computer vision project titled "Enhanced Face and Eye Detection in Real-Time Using Haarcascades in OpenCV." 🔍

This project focuses on detecting human faces and eyes live from a webcam using Python, OpenCV, and pre-trained Haarcascade models. It's lightweight, fast, and can be deployed on both desktops and embedded systems.

✅ Key Highlights:

Real-time face and eye detection using webcam input 🎥

Built using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy

Implemented with Haarcascade classifiers for efficient detection

Optimized for performance with smooth detection and minimal latency

Potential applications in security, surveillance, and human-computer interaction

This was a great opportunity to strengthen my skills in computer vision, machine learning fundamentals, and real-time video processing. 📈

🔗 Tools used: Python, OpenCV, Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda

I’d love to connect with fellow AI/ML and computer vision enthusiasts! 🤝
